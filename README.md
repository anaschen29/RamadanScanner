# RamadanScanner


Assalamu Alaykom! This is how we are running the tap access system for Ramadan 2024 at MIT. Here is a general overview of how to run this for a day's iftar on a mac/linux. 
1) `cd` into the directory and clone the git repo by running `git clone https://github.com/anaschen29/RamadanScanner.git` 
2) Run the create_files.py script (you can do this using the command `python3 create_files.py` or `python create_files.py`). This creates a .txt file for the day's taps, and should display something like _Empty file 'taps/taps(03-25).txt' created._ **ONLY DO THIS ONCE PER DAY.**
3) Run the app.py script (again, you can do `python3 app.py` or `python app.py`).
      This will run on your local device a flask app which you will use to tap people in.
